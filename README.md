SLogo
=====
A team project (5-person group) for Duke's Computer Science 308 (Design and Implementation). For this third project, we built a turtle-based IDE for the Logo language (approximately 6300 lines of code). 

This program is capable of executing SLogo code in a variety of languages; of animating turtle movements; of running existing SLogo scripts; and of keeping track of a variety of workspaces.
